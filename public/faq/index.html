          <summary>What does this optimizer calculate?</summary>
          <p>
            It searches armor, charm, and decoration combinations that meet selected skill targets and
            ranks valid results by defense and slot efficiency.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is the difference between Charm Mode Off, Suggest After, and Owned?</summary>
          <p>
            Off disables charm post-processing. Suggest After adds theoretical RNG charm templates after
            builds are generated. Owned evaluates your imported owned charm list.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Are suggested RNG charms real charms I own?</summary>
          <p>
            No. Suggest After outputs theoretical templates intended to complete missing targets. They are
            not automatically treated as owned charms.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can set or group skills be rolled on RNG charms?</summary>
          <p>
            No. Set and group skills are excluded from RNG charm suggestions. Only rollable skill types
            are used for suggested templates.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Why do I get no results?</summary>
          <p>
            Typical causes are too many high targets at once, strict armor/deco filters, or near-miss
            disabled. Try lowering one or two targets, broadening your decoration pool, or enabling
            near-miss results.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What does Allow Near-Miss Solver Results do?</summary>
          <p>
            It keeps builds that are slightly short on requested levels so charm processing can complete
            them. Near-Miss Max Missing Points controls how short those builds may be.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Why might HIGH charm dependence not appear?</summary>
          <p>
            HIGH appears only when a build materially depends on charm completion. If required deficits
            are already zero before charm help, dependence will be LOW or NONE.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What performance settings are recommended?</summary>
          <p>
            Start with default Max Threads (about 80% of available threads) and Max Results Per Thread
            around 25 to 50. Raise values gradually while watching responsiveness.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do I use Owned Charm Builder with the optimizer?</summary>
          <p>
            Create/import charms in Owned Charm Builder, then set Charm Mode to Owned in the optimizer.
            Both pages use the same local storage key.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Where does the gear data come from?</summary>
          <p>
            The app uses MHDB Wilds API data for armor, armor sets, skills, decorations, and charms.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Does this tool calculate weapon damage?</summary>
          <p>No. This project is skill-first build planning for armor sets and related setup.</p>
