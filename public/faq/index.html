            <summary>Which settings should I choose first?</summary>
            <p>
              Start with Charm Mode = Off, Allow alpha/gamma = On, all decorations selected, and near-miss
              off. Once you get a stable baseline, enable Suggest After and near-miss for guided expansion.

              Off disables charm post-processing. Suggest After adds theoretical RNG charm templates after
              builds are generated. Owned evaluates your imported owned charm list.

            <summary>What does Allow Near-Miss Solver Results do?</summary>
            <p>
              It keeps builds that are slightly short on requested skills so completion modes can still
              evaluate them. Near-Miss Max Missing Points controls how short those builds may be.

              No. The optimizer automatically checks relevant Artian weapon +1 set-piece coverage

              Yes. Share links preserve requested targets and filters, and automatic weapon set-bonus
              inference runs from that same state.
